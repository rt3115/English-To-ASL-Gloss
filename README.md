# English-To-ASL-Gloss
A simple application made during a series on twitch.tv/strychnos of simple/fun coding projects. This application will translate English sentences to ASL (American Sign Language) Gloss. This would be direct translation of signs to English words but in reverse. ASL has its own grammar, rules, words and lack of direct translations.
