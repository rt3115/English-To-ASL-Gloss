# English-To-ASL-Gloss
A simple application made during a series on twitch.tv/strychnos of simple/fun coding projects. This application will translate English sentences to ASL (American Sign Language) Gloss. This would be direct translation of signs to English words but in reverse. ASL has its own grammar, rules, words and lack of direct translations. 

## How to use

## How it works
User imputs a setence, the system will assign words their types (nouns, adjective etc) and then the system will try to organize the sentence into ASL gloss. \
Lets look at an example \
(screen caps here) \
English: She's upset that she lost her money \
ASL Gloss: HER MONEY LOST, SHE UPSET \
\
In order to understand this sentence first the system will try and the user will confirm that parts of the sentence as the context is very important \
The topic is she lost her money and the comment is that is upset. \
'Lost her money' would be identified as the topic/subject and 'She's upset' is the comment on the subject \
However from there those chunks need to be worked on as well, lost can not go first as the who needs to be established first. \
Her is first as we are not referring to the person, ok now her what? her money, the structure here is person person's object then what happened. \
The second chunck is done in a similiar way, and in this case does not need any processing but we'll walk through that as well. \
Object/subject first, in this case, who? She, she what? She's upset. To clean it up, we remove all ' and plural as they are not needed.
